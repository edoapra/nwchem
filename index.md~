# NWChem: Open Source High-Performance Computational Chemistry


![caption](Bylaska-Figure3.PNG) NWChem aims to provide its
users with computational chemistry tools that are scalable both in their
ability to treat large scientific computational chemistry problems
efficiently, and in their use of available parallel computing resources
from high-performance parallel supercomputers to conventional
workstation clusters.

NWChem software can handle:

  - Biomolecules, nanostructures, and solid-state
  - From quantum to classical, and all combinations
  - Ground and excited-states
  - Gaussian basis functions or plane-waves
  - Scaling from one to thousands of processors
  - Properties and relativistic effects

NWChem is actively developed by a consortium of developers and
maintained by the [EMSL](http://www.emsl.pnl.gov) located at the Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory ([PNNL](http://www.pnl.gov)) in Washington
State. Researchers interested in contributing to NWChem should review
the [Developers page](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Developer). The
code is distributed as open-source under the terms of the [Educational
Community License
version 2.0](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ecl2.php) (ECL 2.0).

The NWChem development strategy is focused on providing new and
essential scientific capabilities to its users in the areas of kinetics
and dynamics of chemical transformations, chemistry at interfaces and in
the condensed phase, and enabling innovative and integrated research at
EMSL. At the same time continued development is needed to enable NWChem
to effectively utilize architectures of tens of petaflops and beyond.

## *NWChem version 7.0.0 can be downloaded from this* [https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem/releases/tag/v7.0.0-release ''link''](https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem/releases/tag/v7.0.0-release_''link'')

## EMSL Arrows

[right|200px|caption](file:myarrowmovie.gif) Are you just
learning NWChem and would like to have an easy way to generate input
decks, check your output decks against a large database of calculations,
perform simple thermochemistry calculations, calculate the NMR and IR
spectra of a modest size molecule, or just try out NWChem before
installing it? EMSL Arrows scientific service can help. A Web API to
EMSL Arrows is now available for Alpha testing.
